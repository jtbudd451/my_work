Source code file name(s):
MyLZW.java

****** FEATURES INCLUDED ********
- Algorith varies in size of the output/input codewords from 9 to 16 bits
- Codeword size increases when all of the codewords of a pervious size have been used

- 3 Modes included to respond to when the codebook has filled up (i.e. when all 16-bit codewords have been used)
	- Mode is chosen as a command line argument during compression with n r and m each representing the three modes.
	- The user does not need to state which mode during expansion
	

1. Do Nothing Mode 	n_mode
	- Does nothing and continue using the full codebook
2. Reset Mode 		r_mode
	- Reset the dictionary back to its initial state 
	- so that a new code book can be added
3. Monitor Mode 	m_mode
	- Initially does nothing
	- begin monitoring the compression ration whenever the codebook is filled
		- Define the compression ratio to be the size of the uncompressed data that has been processed/generated so far divided by the size of the compressed data generated/processed so far (for compression/expansion, respectively).
	- If the compression ratio degrades by more than a set threshold from the point when the last codeword was added, then reset the dictionary back to its initial state. 
	- ratio of compression ratios [(old ratio)/(new ratio)], where old ratio is the ratio recorded when your program last filled the codebook, and new ratio is the current compression ratio


- does not account for modes other than n r or m... any other input will result in do nothing mode
- DONT UPLOAD 14 SAMPLE FILES
-LZW from book 



Other file name(s) (if relevant):

MyLZW.java) requires the following library files (also developed by the textbook authors): BinaryStdIn.java, BinaryStdOut.java, TST.java, Queue.java, StdIn.java, and StdOut.java. These files have already been added to your repository, within the package edu.princeton.cs.algs4.
